# Duelling wizards
We have everything for a good old battle. Of course, at Hogwarts, battling happens at a duelling club.
A duel is between 2 wizards until one of them has no hp left.

Try to have some feedback during the battle as well. Show all the spells that are summoned.
After each spell, show hp from the opponent.

* Every wizard has 100hp
* Every attacking spell has between 5 and 15 damage (you can choose freely at each spell, hardcoded)
* Defending spells has no damage atm
* unforgivable spells have 50 damage
